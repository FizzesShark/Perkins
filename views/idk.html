 <br/>
 <br/>If you are a qualified public educational or government institution and any part of this Agreement, such as, by way of example, all or part of the indemnification section, is invalid or unenforceable against you because of applicable local, national, state or federal law, then that portion shall be deemed invalid or unenforceable, as the case may be, and instead construed in a manner most consistent with applicable governing law.
 <br/>
 <br/>GOVERNING LAW
 <br/>
 <br/>Except to the extent expressly provided in the following paragraph, this Agreement and the relationship between you and Peer Review, and all Transactions on the Services shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions.

If (a) you are not a U.S. citizen; (b) you do not reside in the U.S.; (c) you are not accessing the Service from the U.S.; and (d) you are a citizen of one of the countries identified below, you hereby agree that any dispute or claim arising from this Agreement shall be governed by the applicable law set forth below, without regard to any conflict of law provisions, and you hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the state, province or country identified below whose law governs:
 <br/>
 <br/>If you are a citizen of any European Union country or Switzerland, Norway or Iceland, the governing law and forum shall be the laws and courts of your usual place of residence.

Peer Review's failure to enforce any right or provisions in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such or any other provision. Peer Review will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.
